# Feral WCL Analyzer
This project is a Python-based tool designed to analyze World of Warcraft combat logs, specifically for Feral Druids. It fetches and processes combat data from the Warcraft Logs API, providing insights into player performance and fight statistics.

# Warcraft Logs API
The tool interacts with the Warcraft Logs API to retrieve combat data. It uses GraphQL queries to fetch detailed information about fights, events, and player performance. The API requires an access token for authentication.
